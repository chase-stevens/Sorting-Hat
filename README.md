Folks just have to say !s for slytherin, although !Slytherin or !something else entirely will have the same effect. 

It's set to work in only two channels, one called sorting hat (ref'd by ID) and the bot-test channel. 

You can figure out the role ID's to fill the config by doing something like 
@role \@role
or 
\#channel

the slashy boy will show up as the Identifier, you copy that number between the " "'s. Digits only.
